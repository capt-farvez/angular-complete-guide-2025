# Angular Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Angular projects developed as part of the "Angular - The Complete Guide (2025 Edition)" course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller throught Udemy. Each project is a standalone application that explores different aspects of the Angular framework, from the basics to advanced topics.

## Projects

The repository is organized into the following projects:

1.  **First Test App**: A simple application to get started with the basic concepts of Angular.
2.  **Task Management App**: A more complex application that introduces concepts like services, data binding, and component communication.
3.  **Investment Calculator**: An application that demonstrates how to work with forms and user input.
4.  **Ticket App**: A project that explores the use of routing and navigation in Angular.
5.  **Component Lifecycle Deep Dive**: A project that provides a detailed look at the component lifecycle in Angular.
6.  **HTTP RnR**: A project that demonstrates how to make HTTP requests and handle responses in Angular.
7.  **HTTP User Input Form**: These project combines forms and HTTP requests to create a user input form that interacts with a backend.
8.  **Routing MPA-SPA**: These projects explores the differences between multi-page applications (MPAs) and single-page applications (SPAs) and how to implement routing in both.
9.  **Lazy Loading**: These projects demonstrates how to use lazy loading to improve the performance of an Angular application.
10. **Deployment**: These projects covers the process of deploying an Angular application to a production environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate to the project's directory and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
ng serve -o
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server. You can then view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4200/`.
